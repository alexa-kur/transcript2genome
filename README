At this moment here are three files:
1) valid_gtf.pl
2)mRNA2genomeBAM.pl
3) example.sh
4) take_fasta_from_gtf.pl
5) wig_parse.pl


VALID_GTF.PL
validation of gtf is neeeded when our transcript names differin BAM and gtf.
At now 'valid_gtf.pl' takes standard GoldenPath RefGene.txt and creates file
for Bowtie.

mRNA2genomeBAM.pl
Usage of mRNA2genomeBAM.pl is described in it's help. Try '-h' or '--help'.

TAKE_FASTA_FROM_GTF.PL
This script makes fasta RefSeq file from validated GTF files and genome reference

WIG_PARSE.PL
This script parses WIG file and create GTF table that contains raws with continious
regions. Actually, it's a very simple peakfinder

NOTES
You have to keep in mind that fact that output of 'main_current.pl' now is
in SAM format, so after it's job have be done, you need to create BAM, sort it
and then make index file. for samtools, it will be as:

$ samtools view -bS output.sam > output.bam
$ samtools sort output.bam output_sorted
$ samtools index output_sorted.bam


you can write script as the example.sh that is also in repo
